            <p class="step">
              Over the past two decades, a devastating trend has emerged in the
              United States as suicide rates have steadily risen year after
              year. From 1999 to 2020, the country experienced a shocking
              increase of nearly 23% in suicide rates, with the sharpest
              increase occurring between 2016 and 2017 when it reached its peak.
              This trend has left behind a trail of heartbreak, loss, and
              unanswered questions. Although suicide is a complex issue with a
              variety of contributing factors, it is clear that this trend
              demands our attention and action as a society. From increasing
              awareness and education to implementing targeted interventions and
              support, it is essential that we come together to address this
              crisis and prevent further loss of life.

            <p class="step">
              In the tumultuous years between 2016 and 2020, the United States
              experienced a concerning trend in suicide rates, with clear
              disparities emerging among racial groups. The white population
              witnessed the highest suicide rate, followed by Asian Americans,
              American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and finally, African Americans.
              These numbers were not evenly distributed across the political
              spectrum, as the white suicide rate peaked in Republican-leaning
              states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas. Interestingly, the
              Asian American community experienced the highest suicide rates in
              Democratic states like California. Meanwhile, the American
              Indian/Alaskan Native suicide rate followed a similar trend to the
              white population, with the most significant numbers occurring in
              Republican-dominated states. This complex intersection of racial
              and political factors paints a harrowing portrait of mental health
              struggles faced by communities across the country, calling for
              deeper investigation into the underlying issues and policies that
              may have contributed to these troubling statistics.

            <p class="step">
              In the United States, from 1999 to 2020, Native Americans
              experienced the highest suicide rates among all racial groups,
              followed by Whites. A particularly striking surge in suicide rates
              among Indian Americans occurred in 2008, coinciding with the
              devastating effects of the Great Recession. This tumultuous period
              is believed to have been a significant factor behind the alarming
              increase in suicides within this community. In contrast, both
              Black and Asian populations consistently displayed the lowest
              suicide rates during this timeframe, with the trends between these
              two groups mirroring one another.

            </div>

            <p class="step">
              The numbers are in, and the results are staggering. In 2020,
              firearms were involved in approximately 52.8% of all suicide
              deaths in the United States, making it the most common method by
              far. The second most prevalent method was suffocation, which
              accounted for approximately 27.2% of suicides. Poisoning came in
              third place, contributing to roughly 12% of all suicide deaths. As
              these statistics reveal, individuals struggling with suicidal
              thoughts often gravitate toward the most accessible means,
              emphasizing the importance of addressing not only the root causes
              of suicide but also the availability of potentially lethal tools.

            <p class="step">
              These gender-specific trends in suicide methods reveal some
              striking insights into the ways in which males and females differ
              in their approaches to suicide. For males, firearms remain the
              most common method of committing suicide, and this trend has been
              on the rise in recent years. While the use of suffocation and
              poisoning has seen a slight decline since 2017, firearms continue
              to be the method of choice for many men. In contrast, females have
              historically relied on poisoning as the most common method of
              suicide, but this trend has shifted dramatically in recent years.
              Since 2015, firearms have become the most prevalent method of
              suicide among females as well, suggesting a growing trend of
              firearm use in suicide among women. Additionally, there has been a
              significant increase in suicides by suffocation among females,
              which further underscores the need for targeted prevention and
              intervention efforts that address the unique challenges faced by
              both genders in terms of suicide risk and prevention.

              Data (2016-2020) reveals a significant regression coefficient of
              0.6, indicating a positive correlation between the number of
              households owning guns and suicide rates per 100k population. In
              other words, states with higher levels of gun ownership tend to
              have higher suicide rates. The data further showed that Republican
              states tended to have higher rates of gun possession and suicide,
              as compared to Democratic states. Notably, Wyoming, a Republican
              state, exhibited the highest rates of both gun possession and
              suicide, while Democratic-leaning New Jersey displayed the lowest
              rates in these categories. These findings suggest that political
              affiliations and gun control policies may play a role in suicide
              rates, emphasizing the importance of considering the broader
              societal context when addressing this public health issue.

            <p class="step">
              A closer examination of gun-related deaths reveals stark
              differences between genders and racial groups. White females were
              more likely to use guns for suicide than for homicide, while the
              opposite trend was observed among males. Among males in the
              country, gun deaths in 2020 were more frequently due to suicide
              rather than homicide, except for Black and Hispanic populations.
              These trends indicate a significant divergence in the reasons for
              gun-related deaths between males and females, as well as among
              various racial groups. This trends shows that restricting
              accessibility to guns has the potential to significantly impact
              suicide mortality rates. By implementing stronger gun control
              measures and reducing the availability of firearms, at-risk
              individuals may face increased difficulty in accessing lethal
              means for self-harm. This reduction in access could lead to lower
              impulsive suicide attempts and provide a crucial window for
              intervention and support

              The issue of veteran suicide has been a pressing concern in the
              United States, and recent data from 2008 to 2011 highlights some
              alarming trends. Notably, suicide rates among veterans were
              highest in states located in the West and the Mountain regions,
              including Montana, Nevada, Arizona, and Colorado. In contrast,
              Northeastern states such as New Jersey and New York had the lowest
              rates of veteran suicide. These findings underscore the importance
              of understanding the unique challenges faced by veterans in
              different parts of the country and the need for targeted
              interventions that address the underlying factors contributing to
              suicide risk among this vulnerable population. Montana had the
              highest veteran suicide rate in the country, while Massachusetts
              and Nebraska had the lowest. It is imperative that we continue to
              raise awareness about this issue, provide support and resources
              for veterans, and work towards reducing the incidence of suicide
              among those who have bravely served our country.
