          Suicide is a pressing public health concern that continues to
          devastate families and communities across the United States. With a
          rising number of individuals succumbing to this preventable tragedy,
          understanding the factors contributing to suicide rates becomes
          critical in designing effective interventions and policies. Our data
          visualization aims to shed light on the complex interplay between
          suicide rates, methods, and gun laws across different states,
          providing a comprehensive and comparative perspective on this crucial
          issue.

                Over the past two decades, a devastating trend has emerged in the
                United States as suicide rates have steadily risen year after
                year. From 1999 to 2020, the country experienced a shocking
                increase of nearly 23% in suicide rates, with the sharpest
                increase occurring between 2016 and 2017 when it reached its peak.
                This trend has left behind a trail of heartbreak, loss, and

                and 2015 reveals some stark gender differences in suicide rates
                across different industries. Notably, male workers in the
                construction and extraction industries had the highest suicide
                rates in both years, suggesting a need for targeted prevention and

              <p class="viz-text">In the tumultuous years between 2016 and 2020, the United States
                experienced a concerning trend in suicide rates, with clear
                disparities emerging among racial groups. The white population
                witnessed the highest suicide rate, followed by Asian Americans,
                American Indians/Alaskan Natives, and finally, African Americans.
                These numbers were not evenly distributed across the political
                spectrum, as the white suicide rate peaked in Republican-leaning
                states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas. Interestingly, the
                Asian American community experienced the highest suicide rates in
                Democratic states like California. Meanwhile, the American
                Indian/Alaskan Native suicide rate followed a similar trend to the
                white population, with the most significant numbers occurring in
                Republican-dominated states. This complex intersection of racial
                and political factors paints a harrowing portrait of mental health

                among Indian Americans occurred in 2008, coinciding with the
                devastating effects of the Great Recession. This tumultuous period
                is believed to have been a significant factor behind the alarming
                increase in suicides within this community. In contrast, both

                most common method of committing suicide, and this trend has been
                on the rise in recent years. While the use of suffocation and
                poisoning has seen a slight decline since 2017, firearms continue
                to be the method of choice for many men. In contrast, females have

                suicide, but this trend has shifted dramatically in recent years.
                Since 2015, firearms have become the most prevalent method of

                other words, states with higher levels of gun ownership tend to
                have higher suicide rates. The data further showed that Republican
                states tended to have higher rates of gun possession and suicide,
                as compared to Democratic states. Notably, Wyoming, a Republican

                more likely to use guns for suicide than for homicide, while the
                opposite trend was observed among males. Among males in the
                country, gun deaths in 2020 were more frequently due to suicide
                rather than homicide, except for Black and Hispanic populations.
                These trends indicate a significant divergence in the reasons for
                gun-related deaths between males and females, as well as among
                various racial groups. This trends shows that restricting
                accessibility to guns has the potential to significantly impact
                suicide mortality rates. By implementing stronger gun control
                measures and reducing the availability of firearms, at-risk
                individuals may face increased difficulty in accessing lethal
                means for self-harm. This reduction in access could lead to lower
