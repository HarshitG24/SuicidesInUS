            One contributing factor to the rising suicide rates is the lack of
            access to mental health care. Many people who are struggling with
            mental health issues do not have access to the resources they need
            to get help, such as counseling or therapy. This can lead to
            feelings of hopelessness and despair, which may ultimately lead to
            suicide. It is essential that we work to increase access to mental
            health care, especially in underserved communities, to ensure that
            everyone has access to the care they need.

            In the United States, socioeconomic disparities among various

            and stable employment. Marginalized communities, such as African

            affected by poverty, low-wage jobs, and underinvestment in their

            As we found that guns were the most common method for committing
            suicide. Let’s delve deeper into it and try to find if the states
            which had higher possessions of guns had more suicide rates.
          </p>
          <p class="viz-text">
            Data (2016-2020) reveals a significant regression coefficient of
            0.6, indicating a
            <strong class="neg"
              >positive correlation between the number of households owning guns
              and suicide rates per 100k population.</strong
            >
            In other words, states with higher levels of gun ownership tend to
            have higher suicide rates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data further showed that
            <strong class="neg"
              >Republican states tended to have higher rates of gun possession
              and suicide,</strong
            >
            as compared to Democratic states.
            <strong class="neg"
              >Notably, Wyoming, a Republican state, exhibited the highest rates
              of both gun possession and suicide,</strong
            >
            <strong class="pos"
              >while Democratic-leaning New Jersey displayed the lowest rates in
              these categories.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            These findings suggest that political affiliations and gun control
            policies may play a role in suicide rates, emphasizing the
            importance of considering the broader societal context when
            addressing this public health issue.

            Suicide among U.S. veterans is a significant public health concern,
            as this population faces unique challenges, including the
            psychological impact of military service, the transition to civilian
            life, and navigating the healthcare system. Veterans often
            experience higher rates of mental health issues, such as
            post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, which can
            contribute to suicidal thoughts and behaviors
          </p>
          <p class="viz-text">
            The issue of veteran suicide has been a pressing concern in the
            United States, and recent data from 2005 to 2011 highlights some
            alarming trends. Notably,
            <strong class="neg"
              >suicide rates among veterans were highest in states located in
              the West and the Mountain regions, including Montana, Nevada,
              Arizona, and Colorado.</strong

            In contrast,
            <strong class="pos"
              >Northeastern states such as New Jersey and New York had the
              lowest rates of veteran suicide.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            These findings underscore the importance of understanding the unique
            challenges faced by veterans in different parts of the country and
            the need for targeted interventions that address the underlying
            factors contributing to suicide risk among this vulnerable
            population.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong class="neg"
              >Montana had the highest veteran suicide rate in the
              country,</strong
            >
            while
            <strong class="pos"
              >Massachusetts and Nebraska had the lowest.</strong
            >
            It is imperative that we continue to raise awareness about this
            issue, provide support and resources for veterans, and work towards
            reducing the incidence of suicide among those who have bravely
            served our country.
